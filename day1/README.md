## Day 1
Day 1 is pretty straight forward.

### Part One

Part one is just the sum of all frequencies. Nothing more to say.

### Part Two
In `found` we keep a list of all frequencies.
we keep our current frequency in `freq` and iterate over the change list
always adding our current frequency to the list and look out for the
current frequency.
